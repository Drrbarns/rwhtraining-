      challenge: "Kweku enrolled with zero technical background. He had tried learning online for 8 months with no tangible result — no projects, no income. The primary obstacle was the disconnect between tutorials and real, billable work.",

By Week 5, he was polishing it into a client-ready product. During the Week 6 client acquisition module, he pitched it directly to a private school in Accra he had identified as a target.",
