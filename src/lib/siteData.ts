export const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Do I need any prior coding experience?",

    q: "What exactly will I be able to build after the masterclass?",
    a: "You will build corporate websites, full e-commerce platforms with payment integration, management dashboards (school, hotel, hospital, POS systems), CRM tools, accounting software, and complete SaaS products. These are the exact systems that Ghanaian businesses pay GHS 5,000 – GHS 15,000 to acquire.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the first client really guaranteed?",
    a: "Yes. We have a dedicated Client Acquisition module in Week 6 where you learn lead generation, pitching, proposal writing, and closing. We work individually with every student to ensure you sign your first paying web design contract before the program ends. No exceptions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the paid internship work?",
    a: "After the 6-week masterclass, every graduate transitions directly into a 1-month paid internship at Doctor Barns Tech. You'll work on real live client projects alongside senior developers, building your professional portfolio and getting real work experience on your CV.",

  {
    q: "Can I pay in installments?",
    a: "Yes. We understand that GHS 2,200 is a significant investment. You can secure your seat with a deposit and pay the balance in agreed installments before the cohort starts. WhatsApp us directly on +233209636158 to work out a plan that fits your situation.",
  },
  {
    q: "What tech stack will I learn?",
    a: "You'll master Next.js 15 (React 19), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL), robust authentication systems, Paystack & Moolre payment gateways, Resend email APIs, and Vercel deployment. This is the same cutting-edge stack used by top global startups.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the training online or offline?",
    a: "The masterclass is 100% offline and in-person at 111 Newtown RD, Accra Newtown. We made this deliberate choice — offline immersion produces faster, deeper learning. No distractions. Hands-on mentorship. Peer accountability. It works.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 100K in 2 Weeks Challenge?",
    a: "It's our client generation challenge in Week 6 where you learn to find, pitch, and close high-paying corporate clients. The target is GHS 100,000 worth of web development contracts within 2 weeks of graduating. Students who execute fully consistently exceed this.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many students are in each cohort?",
    a: "We deliberately cap every cohort at exactly 10 students. This is not a mass course — it's a focused, high-intensity development environment where every student gets direct, personalized mentorship from Dr. Barns. Quality over quantity, always.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I receive at the end of the program?",
    a: "You receive: (1) A Diploma Certification in Web Development from Doctor Barns Tech, (2) A professional portfolio of real production projects, (3) Your first signed paying client contract, (4) A 1-month paid internship placement, (5) Lifetime access to the RWH Alumni Network, and (6) A chance at full-time employment.",
